## Results:
This is a good set of baselines for research in model quantization.
These quantization techniques, when applied on AlexNet, achieves the following ImageNet performance in this implementation:

 <a id="ft1">1</a>: These numbers were obtained by training on 8 GPUs with a total batch size of 256 (otherwise the performance may become slightly different).
The DoReFa-Net models reach slightly better performance than our paper, due to
more sophisticated augmentations.

 <a id="ft2">2</a>: Not directly comparable with the original AlexNet. Check out
 [../ImageNetModels](../ImageNetModels) for a more faithful implementation of the original AlexNet.

## Speed:
__DoReFa-Net works on mobile and FPGA!__
We hosted a demo at CVPR16 on behalf of Megvii, Inc, running a 1/4-VGG size DoReFa-Net on a phone and a half-VGG size DoReFa-Net on an FPGA, in real time.
DoReFa-Net and its variants have been deployed widely in Megvii's embeded products.

This code release is meant for research purpose. We're not planning to release our C++ runtime for bit-operations.
In this implementation, quantized operations are all performed through `tf.float32`. They don't make your network faster.

## Use

+ Install TensorFlow â‰¥ 1.7, tensorpack and scipy.

+ Look at the docstring in `*-dorefa.py` to see detailed usage and performance.

Pretrained model for (1,4,32)-ResNet18 and several AlexNet are available at
[tensorpack model zoo](http://models.tensorpack.com/#DoReFa-Net).
They're provided in the format of numpy dictionary.
The __binary-weight 4-bit-activation ResNet-18__ model has 59.2% top-1 validation accuracy.
